Bored this weekend andÂ interested in free/open-source ? Perhaps consider a trip to Brussels, for this awesome event :

FOSDEM is a free and non-commercial event organised by the community for the community. The goal is to provide free and open source software developers and communities a place to meet to:

  * get in touch with other developers and projects;
  * be informed about the latest developments in the free software world;
  * be informed about the latest developments in the open source world;
  * attend interesting talks and presentations on various topics by project leaders and committers;
  * to promote the development and benefits of free software and open source solutions
