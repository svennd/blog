Hell, nobody wants systemd, but its here, and unless you wanne stay old and boring its time to learn the new systemD slang.

Enable a service : (new fromÂ chkconfig apcupsd on)

<pre>systemctl enable apcupsd</pre>

start a service : (new from service apcupsd start)

<pre>systemctl start apcupsd</pre>

There, whats all the fuzz about now ?

btw apcupsd is a monitor for UPS's. Guess who had a power-outage recently ?
