I have been a phpBB fan since phpBB 2, they are the standard for me, when it comes to forum software.  However the phpBB 3 package is complex to work with, it has way too many buttons, the permission system is crazy deep and while phpBB 2 was a fun target for modding, the modding community did not take up phpBB 3 that good IMHO. With the release of phpBB 3.1 they took a different direction, they included a framework, Symfony -now this is personal- but I'm not a huge fan of Symfony either, I'm more of a CodeIgniter guy, though luck. Today I'm searching for alternatives to phpBB, while I am not sure I will find my next forum software package, one thing is certain, its goodbye to phpBB and its not-always-so-friendly community.

I don't think its essential to be free or/and open-source, but its an advantage (one can test before having to commit) . I however require the software runs in a Linux environment so no windows-only tools. (PHP/MySQL is not a requirement, but its the easiest for me, and one of the most used languages) I did sorted this list, by how-much I like them after trying to install and playing with the demo. (allot of forums are missing, feel free to join in!)

**[Flarum][1]**

+ free, open-source  
+ modern design  
+ active development  
+ build for current expectation : (single login, likes, ...)  
+ forget complex forms  
+ wysiwyg editor  
- learning curve ?  
- beta  
- small dev. team (mostly written by 2 people)  
-/+ uses composer, dependency manager for a forum (?) not sure if that is a good thing

**[Discourse][2]**

+ free, open-source  
+ looks amazing  
+ gamification  
+ single sign on (google, facebook, yahoo, github, twitter,...)  
- high requirements (browser)

+/- no LAMP stack

**[nodeBB][3]**

+ look & feel amazing  
+ stable, looks similar to Flarum (which I love)  
+ nice category + fP  
+ tons icons, wyisyg edit  
- editor is rather complex compared to Flarum, 1080p/2 = mobile ?  
- small community, small dev. team (3?)  
- focus on paying customer
