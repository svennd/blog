Googlebot is a real hero, it believes my ancient posts are still not dead. In webmaster tools I still get the message I got 404's on my website, linking to ancient posts I made a few years back. As long as someone remembers they are not dead! -Keep believing that- Â Anyways, while 404 don't really hurt the website -web is dynamic-, its a clean way to report back that there is little to no chance those exact posts will ever return.

One can simply add [410][1]'s to the Nginx configuration to show bots and browsers that the page is removed from the website/database and should not be accessed any longer. I added them manually to the location / with this ugly little hack :

<pre>location / {
if ($uri ~ "/working-on-server-move/") { return 410; }</pre>

if you try something similar first try with a [418 (htcpcp)][2], see a 418 at work.
