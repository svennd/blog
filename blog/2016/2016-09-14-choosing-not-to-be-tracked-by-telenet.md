I![telenot-logo](/img/2016/09/telenot-logo-150x150.jpg) understand that company's need to make money, but if they try to charge double for a single product,  that's where I draw the line. Telenet (a network provider) wants to track both to what you look at on TV and internet use. Basically they collect your information and sell it of to advertisement company's to target you with crappy  ads that are more focused on you, as if the premium price we pay Telenet is not enough for there investors...

Changing it is simple, yet hidden out (IMHO)

  1. Log in at [mijn.telenet.be][1]
  2. Go to "My privacy settings"  (Mijn privacy-instellingen)
  3. Select the "common" setting (Algemeen)

Lets hope we get a more free kabel network soon. Cause they are abusing their power more and more.
