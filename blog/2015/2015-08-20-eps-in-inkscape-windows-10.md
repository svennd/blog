Loading a .eps file in inkscape on windows, is a real pain, I told a colleague, that can't be, its a vector format, should be easy-peasy. The reality of it is however; its not as straightforward as expected. You need a 3th party application installed and put in the environment variable of windows. While for any Linux rookie this is nothing special,  for Windows people, this seems like allot of work. Since those same windows people like images and buttons, this excellent article guides you how to do it :

Confirmed to still work on windows 10, 32bit.
