<pre>Apache: [warn] _default_ VirtualHost overlap on port 80</pre>

This happens when you have 2 or moreÂ <code class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="null">&lt;VirtualHost *:80&gt;</code>Â and did not setÂ <code class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="null">NameVirtualHost *:80</code>Â  This one liner will fix it :

<pre>echo "NameVirtualHost *:80" &gt;&gt; /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf</pre>

Every time I set up a server I forget about this behavior so its mostly for myself. ðŸ™‚
