After adding a bunch of clients, we realized that a good naming convention was required and that some funny names, where not the best choice after all. So we changed them. However, Bareos will remember those Jobs ran against the old Client. The 'new' name will be seen as a new client;Â Some of the scripts we made however found it annoying that some clients where not backed up for weeks. Basically cause they where no longer existing. There is however a way to completely remove them from database.

  * "Restore" the original configuration, or create a new client in the configuration with the old name; (Address / Password does not have to be correct, we just need a name in the configuration)
  * in bconsole : <pre>*purge jobs client=SVENND

This command can be DANGEROUS!!!

It purges (deletes) all Files from a Job,
JobId, Client or Volume; or it purges (deletes)
all Jobs from a Client or Volume without regard
to retention periods. Normally you should use the
PRUNE command, which respects retention periods.
This command requires full access to all resources.
Using Catalog "MyCatalog"
Begin purging jobs from Client "SVENND"
Found 19 Jobs for client "SVENND" in catalog "MyCatalog".
Purge (yes/no)? yes
</pre>

  * After that, the client record will be orphaned, as nothing is ran for it; Now you can clear the database using : <code class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="null">bareos-dbcheck -v -f</code>

<pre>[root@bareos ~]# bareos-dbcheck -v -f

Of course the data of those users are still in the filesystem (or tape) for me that is not really an issue, so I did not look into it.
