Ouch, while trying to connect to a [firebird][1] database (I know its not popular)

<pre>Fatal error: Call to undefined function ibase_connect()</pre>

The solution for me was simple, the module was not installed ! Since I work with centos, I have a [alternativeÂ repo][2] (as the official one doesn't have newer versions of PHP)

<pre>yum install php55w-interbase
service httpd restart</pre>

Restarting httpd and fixed !
