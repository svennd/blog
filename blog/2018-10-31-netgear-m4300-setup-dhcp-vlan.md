We bought our first 10GBase-T switch. Pretty nice, but setting it up proved a bit more complex then our SuperMicro switches. Here I documented my search to get servers to talk to each other over a VLAN using the switch to assign IP addresses, using DHCP.

###### Login & Connect

Logging in proved rather easy and was similar to SuperMicro's, connect "through the back" using a RJ45 alike cable that is actually a serial cable to USB. (I don't think this was included, but there alternatives) Once connected I could find the "COM" port windows assigned checking Bluetooth devices :

One could also open the device manager and find it underÂ _COMÂ _ports. I used putty as my VT100 terminal emulator, on any Linux distro there are plenty of options but the easiest option would beÂ _screen_. The setting of this switch are : 115200 baud speed, 8 data bits, 1 stop bits, none parity, none flow control.

###### Login & connect option 2

Provided by Netgear is a USB to UART, you need this [driver][2] (on Win 10) to connect; you still need the VT100 terminal emulator, so that's the same ðŸ™‚

Connect and enter twice and voila you can see the cli interface, the default login is "admin" and no password.

To get the assigned IP address :

<pre># set ip
ip management vlan 1 10.0.0.10 /24

# get ip
show ip management

# or 
show ip vlan</pre>

After you get the IP address or guess it, you can go to the more simple web-interface configuration option. In my case the IP wasÂ 169.254.100.100. to be greeted with a login page.

Changing the ip on a reset :

<pre># start a new session
set sup-console
# login with admin/password

# elevate user : 
enable 
# enter admin password

# goto configure
configure

# try to config ip
ip management vlan 1 123.123.123.123 255.255.255.0

# or dhcp
ip management vlan 1 dhcp

</pre>

###### Make VLAN

First I needed to make a VLAN, Switching -> VLAN -> basic -> VLAN Configuration. Giving a VLAN ID and a name (disable static).Â  If everything works it should look like :

![vlan configuration m4300](/img/2018/10/switch_vlan.png) 

After this, you need to define the VLAN membership this can be done in Switching -> VLAN -> Advanced -> VLAN Membership. Go to VLAN ID you just made (in my case 400) and select group operation tag all then untag all, so that all ports show as untagged. (U).

![untag VLAN 400 members](/img/2018/10/untag_vlan_members.png) 

From my basic understanding of VLAN's and tagged packets, I figured that a port can only be part of one untagged VLAN. I'm probably wrong, but this "worked". So I made all my ports that I intend to use for data to this new VLAN. Switching -> VLAN -> Advanced -> Port PVID Configuration. I changed VLAN member for all except my management port I'm using (1/0/1). Do this by entering the VLAN ID into VLAN Member and accepting the changes. It should look like :

![port VLAN PVID configuration](/img/2018/10/port_vlan.png) 

Now for some reason, ports are still not able to communicate. Time to add a routing interface.

###### Routing Interface VLAN

_note : changed from 1 to 254._

This is totally new to me so, bare along : Routing -> VLAN -> VLAN Routing Configuration; We need to add routing configuration, from the dropdown select our PVID (400) and create a IP address for the routing (end with **254**) I decided on 10.0.0.254Â  for the IP and subnet mask 255.255.255.0 so eventually IP's allowed will be 10.0.0.[0-255].

It's important to remember this IP adres, as we will re-use it once we setup the DHCP.

###### Setup DHCP service

Seamless next step, would you not say ? We need to setup the DHCP, which can be found : System -> Services -> DHCP Server -> DHCP Server Configuration.

We need to set the Admin Mode toÂ _enabled,Â _and exclude our routing interface, so that this is not given out by the DHCP. It should look like :

![](/img/2018/10/dhcp.png) 

After this we are ready to create the DHCP pool, do this under System -> Services -> DHCP Server -> DHCP Pool Configuration.

Pool name : (random) Type of Binding : Dynamic. Network Addressshould be the one we picked for the routing interface and excluded in the previous step. But instead of 1 use 0. In our case Network Address is 10.0.0.0 and the netmask is 255.255.255.0 or length 24. I setup lease time, to 7 days, which is a weekly thing. Should end up looking like :

![](/img/2018/10/dhcp_setup.png) 

After this the only thing remaining is testing & saving the configuration. If you are happy with how it works save your configuration.Â  Maintenance -> Save Configuration
