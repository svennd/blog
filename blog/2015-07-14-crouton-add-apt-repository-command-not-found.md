While working with my [crouton][1]/[chromebook][2]/[toshiba cb30-102][3](dutch), I hit upon a weird one. While try'ing to install a PPA. I got this error :

<code class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="null">sudo: add-apt-repository: command not found</code>

Since my crouton is a default Ubuntu installation (12.04 LTS) with Xfce, I was stunned, since this is a 'default' command, but seemingly they install a minimalÂ image, and this doesn't include all packets. So the fix is easy as pie :

<code class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="null">sudo apt-get install python-software-properties</code>

Note for newer versions (12.10+) this might be the package name :

<code class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="null">sudo apt-get install software-properties-common</code>
