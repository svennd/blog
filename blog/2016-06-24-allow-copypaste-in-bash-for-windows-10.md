I have finally got to using bash (Ubuntu) for windows 10. I really like it, I like the possibility to run ALL the games I want and still be able to be productive. (ssh from bash, yeeey!) So I started off with moving some repo's (git/svn/darcs) that worked great, but I noticed I could not copy-paste. I googled it (its a [verb][1]) and found this is pretty much default behavior for windows consoles, cause you know, windows consoles...

Anyway the workaround I found for [Git for Windows][2] also works for bash (Ubuntu) on Windows 10.  Since my computer is running in dutch (its really annoying) the screens are also in dutch, but its pretty self explaining.

  1. right click on the top bar -> select properties  
<img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-956 size-full" src="/img//2015/07/25432256-1.png" width="346" height="237" srcset="/img/2015/07/25432256-1.png 346w, /img/2015/07/25432256-1-300x205.png 300w, /img/2015/07/25432256-1-1x1.png 1w" sizes="(max-width: 346px) 100vw, 346px" /> 
  2.  select "Quick edit mode",  now you can use the paste using right mouse ...

<img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-961 size-full" src="/img//2015/07/25442304-1.png" width="571" height="634" srcset="/img/2015/07/25442304-1.png 571w, /img/2015/07/25442304-1-270x300.png 270w, /img/2015/07/25442304-1-1x1.png 1w" sizes="(max-width: 571px) 100vw, 571px" /> 

Happy pasting! Under what category should I post this ... Windows, Linux, Bash, ... ooo Microsoft.
