Auch, I got the same error as [ma.ttias.be][1]Â pretty much two years ago. I have no idea why it failed, however the solution seemed to work similar to what he suggested.

<pre>[Mon Dec 03 15:07:55.871866 2018] [auth_digest:notice] [pid 3352] AH01757: generating secret for digest authentication ...
[Mon Dec 03 15:07:55.871892 2018] [auth_digest:error] [pid 3352] (2)No such file or directory: AH01762: Failed to create shared memory segment on file /run/httpd/authdigest_shm.3352

The directory /run/httpd is gone. So recreate it and give correct permissions; This in my case (on Centos 7X was apache instead of httpd)

<pre>mkdir /run/httpd
chown root.apache /run/httpd
chmod 0710 /run/httpd</pre>

Another solution, sadly the mystery is not solved.
