This is a while ago, a missing library. When trying to decompress bz2 :

<pre># tar -xf words.bz2
tar (child): lbzip2: Cannot exec: No such file or directory
tar (child): Error is not recoverable: exiting now
tar: Child returned status 2
tar: Error is not recoverable: exiting now
</pre>

Something is missing to decompress bz2, that something is bzip2 ðŸ™‚

<pre>dnf install bzip2
yum install bzip2
</pre>

Now it should decompress ðŸ™‚
