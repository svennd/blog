Okay so while playing with older hardware I faced an issue on Centos 8 where my RAID controller was not being recognized;

I found this method to be working;

from [ElRepo][1]

```yum install https://www.elrepo.org/elrepo-release-8.el8.elrepo.noarch.rpm```

then install

```yum install kmod-megaraid_sas```

I got this "warning" during installation :  
```Failed to add dependency on unit, unit systemd-ask-password-plymouth.service does not exist.```

But after a reboot the raid controller just worked as if nothing had ever happened ðŸ™‚
