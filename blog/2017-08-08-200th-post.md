Yeaaaj, [100 more][1] badly written articles and barely working guides ! Well seems I enjoyed making them and somehow something likes to read them. Some statistics to show off !

Like last time, users/bots seem to drop off during the weekend, compared to last time the effect is even easier to see. I assume part of the traffic comes from people searching for help during work hours. Long live weekends.

Overall traffic has been increasing, not really sure why there was a drop last month, neither do I really care. Obv. the last point is still new (since its only 8 days in the month)

I was not aware but clearly Thursdays are my blog day. Last time, Friday (2) and Wednesday (3) where close follow-ups. Tuesday who came up as second to last, is now my 4th most active day, and Saturday keeps being the last on the row.

On to the next 100 articles ðŸ™‚
