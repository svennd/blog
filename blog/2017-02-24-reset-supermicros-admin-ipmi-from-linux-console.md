Once _ipmitools_ are installed (if not see [this post][1]) its easy :

<pre>ipmitool -I open user set password 2 NEW_PASSWORD</pre>

(the capitals are the new password)

The 2 stands for second user, all the machines I have seen 1 is "guest" who has no access.

You can find a list of all users by issuing :

<pre>ipmitool user list 1</pre>
