Starting the new year with :

<pre>No space left on device</pre>

I looked to the usual suspects (/tmp, /data, ...) Â but nothing excessive ... It was my [sanoid][1] setup, woops! AÂ gazillion snapshots ! For some reason one of my containers changes around ~300 Gb a day, and guess who keeps 60 days of snapshots, on top of 6 months snapshots ? -> you guessed right.

Its annoying ZFS does not warn you, or that sanoid doesn't take care, not to fill it up 100% . Not that's its there task, but still, it was holidays for everyone guys ! So how to fix this ? Simply remove excessive snapshots (those can be deleted)

<pre>zfs destroyÂ jbod1/users@autosnap_2016-12-09_14:00:01_hourly</pre>

Note that during a 100% full you can't remove data due to Copy On Write (COW) so rm\`ing a big file would result in :

<pre># rm /that/big/file
Can't remove /that/big/file. No space left on the device.</pre>

What you can do (if you can't remove snapshots, or you just filled it up the old fashion way)

<pre>echo &gt; /that/big/file</pre>

Credits for this great solution go to [this guy][2].

Best wishes for 2017 ðŸ™‚
