So our [ZFSÂ server][1] running Centos 7 has some problems, and we needed to verify that the data was okÃ©, and for good measure sync our backup. Â Getting ZFS on mint was surprisingly difficult, perhaps cause of my close to zero knowledge about Mint, or perhaps its hanging a bit in limbo right now ... Allot of guides on how to get booted using ZFS, but little on just the installation on Mint and not on Ubuntu. I tried (and failed) to use the [debian guide][2], the [-native- Ubuntu ppa][3]Â and even the [UbuntuÂ ][4]. In the end I found it using scraps all over the net... weird, since I was under the impression Mint was a beginner-user-friendly distro ... well I guess beginners can't have ZFS. Here goes :

Installing the [zfs-native][3] seems the best option :

<pre>sudo add-apt-repository ppa:zfs-native/stable
sudo apt-get update</pre>

Note : some errors around CD-ROM can be ignored. (I think)

<pre>W: Failed to fetch cdrom://Linux Mint 17.3 _Rosa_ - Release amd64 20160105/dists/trusty/non-free/binary-i386/Packages  Please use apt-cdrom to make this CD-ROM recognized by APT. apt-get update cannot be used to add new CD-ROMs</pre>

Next you need to install build tools :

<pre>apt-get install build-essential</pre>

It doesn't seem to have a dependency set on build-essentials, so do it in two stepsÂ ! Then finally install zfs ... ubuntu-zfs :/

<pre>apt-get install spl-dkms zfs-dkms ubuntu-zfs</pre>

What was installed is not really clear to me, but I could find my ZFS again, after doing :

<pre>modprobe zfs</pre>

Finding the zpool can be done using :

<pre>zpool import</pre>

and to import the set : (dataet = pool name)

<pre>zpool import dataset</pre>

happy recovery ðŸ™‚

Note Â : on Mint 18.1 you don't have to install the apt anymore, you can simply install

<pre>apt-get install zfs
or 
apt-get install zfsutils-linux</pre>
