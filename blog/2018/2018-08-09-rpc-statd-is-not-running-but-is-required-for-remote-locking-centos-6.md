Got this error :

<pre>mount.nfs: rpc.statd is not running but is required for remote locking.
mount.nfs: Either use '-o nolock' to keep locks local, or start statd.
mount.nfs: an incorrect mount option was specified</pre>

You forgot the rpcbind service !

<pre>yum install rpcbind
service rpcbind start
chkconfig rpcbind on</pre>

Glad to help ðŸ˜‰
